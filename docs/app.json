You'll then want to make sure that the app imports the new data - in `app.R`, you'll need to add to the `all_datasets` line:\n```r\nall_datasets <- list(\n    <other previous datasets>\n    ..., \n    read.csv(\"raw_polls/<POLL_FILE_NAME>.csv\")\n)\n```\n\nThen you'll need to deploy the app, either through ShinyApps or Github pages:\n\n### ShinyApps deployment\nOpen up the R console (make sure you've already performed the set-up per the section below; see that section as well if you need a refresher on how to open the console) and run the following 2 commands:\n```r\nlibrary(rsconnect)\nrsconnect::deployApp(appFiles = c(\"app.R\", list.files(\"raw_polls\", recursive = TRUE, full.names = TRUE)))\n```\n\n### Github pages deployment (backup)\nThe site can also be deployed through Github pages as a backup option. (Github pages does not have a backend server, so all data is loaded and processed each time the page is loaded, so it takes a while to start up when visiting the page.)\n\nTo deploy it with Github pages, open up the R console, and run the following command.\n```r\nshinylive::export(\".\", \"docs\")\n```\n\nThen commit and push the changes to the repository - Github will automatically then deploy the site, as exported to the `docs/` folder.\n\n## R Set-up\n\nYou'll first want to [install R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)! (As of March 2025, it appears that ShinyApps only supports up to R version 4.4.1, so try to install that or an earlier version.) Then, you'll want to [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open up the R console in your IDE of choice. Instructions are given below for using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).\n\n### VSCode\n\nFirst, install the [R extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r). Then, to open the R interactive console, first click \"Terminal\" in the top right, which will cause a terminal will appear as a new window at the bottom of your screen. Click the dropdown error next to the \"+\" in the top right of the new window, and then click \"R terminal\" to open the console.\n\n### RStudio\n\nAfter opening the repository in RStudio, the console will appear as a window on the left side of the screen, labeled as such.\n\n### Installing dependencies and setting up ShinyApps\n\nOnce you have an R console open, you'll want to install any dependencies used by the dashboard and for its deployment. To do so, run the following command in your terminal\n```\ninstall.packages(c(\"anesrake\", \"pollster\", \"tidyverse\", \"dplyr\", \"tidyr\", \"stringr\", \"rlang\", \"ggplot2\", \"shiny\", \"rsconnect\", \"survey\", \"viridis\", \"sortable\", \"lubridate\", \"shinylive\"))\n```\n\nYou'll then need to provide the `rsconnect` package with authorization to deploy to BOP's ShinyApps account. To do so, log in to [ShinyApps](https://www.shinyapps.io/) using BOP's Google account (`brownopinionproject.pres@gmail.com`). Then click \"Account\" on the bar in the top left, and then \"Tokens\" in the dropdown menu that appears. You should see a list containing one authentication token - click \"Show\" for that token, and then follow the steps it provides. Now you're all set to deploy changes to the dashboard!","type":"text"},{"name":"boptools.Rproj","content":"Version: 1.0\n\nRestoreWorkspace: Default\nSaveWorkspace: Default\nAlwaysSaveHistory: Default\n\nEnableCodeIndexing: Yes\nUseSpacesForTab: Yes\nNumSpacesForTab: 2\nEncoding: UTF-8\n\nRnwWeave: Sweave\nLaTeX: pdfLaTeX\n","type":"text"},{"name":"raw_polls/BOP April 2024 Poll.csv","content":"\"Timestamp\",\"What is your current graduation year?\",\"How would you describe your gender identity?
